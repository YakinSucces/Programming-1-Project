# Programming-1-Project
This project is meant to find one of the 5 traits of successful athletes which is the Number of Effective Exercise Hours (NEEH) per day. To achieve this, they will check the NEEH value of 15 high performance athletes that range between 3 and 11. Moreover, the researchers want to know the number of athletes which have NEEH above each other and the NEEH recorded by the maximum number of athletes. Precisely, this project will include an array data structure to store the NEEHs, the use of accessors and mutator methods, constructors, an equal method, and a toString method in a class. The main driver program will output the results presented in a Column Format, Histogram, or both.
